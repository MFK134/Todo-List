Project Description: A ReactJS-based to-do list app that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, and mark them as complete.

Installation: Clone the project from GitHub using the command git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git and run npm install to install the required dependencies.

Features: The to-do list app will have the following features:

Users can add tasks to the list.
Users can edit tasks in the list.
Users can mark tasks as complete.
Users can delete tasks from the list.
The app will display the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks.
Components: The to-do list app will have the following components:
App: This will be the main component that will render all other components.
TaskList: This will display the list of tasks.
TaskItem: This will display each task in the list.
AddTaskForm: This will allow users to add tasks to the list.
EditTaskForm: This will allow users to edit tasks in the list.
Styling: The to-do list app will have a simple and clean design with a list of tasks on the left, and forms to add and edit tasks on the right.

Data Flow: When a user adds a task using the AddTaskForm component, it will update the state of the App component and render the updated TaskList component. When a user edits a task using the EditTaskForm component, it will update the state of the App component and render the updated TaskList component. When a user marks a task as complete or deletes a task, it will update the state of the App component and render the updated TaskList component.

Testing: The to-do list app can be tested using Jest and Enzyme to ensure that it properly adds, edits, and deletes tasks, and marks them as complete.

Deployment: The to-do list app can be deployed on a web server using a cloud hosting service like AWS or Heroku.
